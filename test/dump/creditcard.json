The same zero annual fee also applies to the supplementary holder. For finance charges, there are different rates for both government employee and non-government employee. For government employee, a consistent minimum monthly repayment will allow the cardholder to enjoy a finance charge of 11% per annum while a non-government employee will result in a low finance charge of 13.5% to be charged on the oustanding balance. However, if the repayment is paid after the due date, it will be 17.5% per annum for both government employee and non-government employee. The minimum repayment is 5% of the outstanding balance or minimum of RM50, whichever is higher. On top of that, there will be a late payment penalty of RM5 or 1% of oustanding balance (depending on which is higher), up to a maximum of RM50. All these charges are subjected by 6% GST effective 1 April 2015.\r\n###Are You Eligible For The BSN Platinum Card?\r\nYou will need to have a minimum monthly income of RM5,000 and to be at least 21 years old to apply for the BSN Platinum Card (principal cardholder). For the supplementary cardholder, you will need to be at least 18 years old. \r\n\r\nLooking for more options to choose from?

The cashbacks that you get to enjoy are not capped in any way unlike most credit cards from other banks; that despite giving a high cashback value, is mostly capped at a low maximum amount of rebates that you get to enjoy. On top of that, the principal cardholder will get to enjoy an automatic Group Takaful protection which gives coverage of up to RM100,000 together with funeral expenses benefit of up to RM1,000. Getting this card through a balance transfer will allow you to enjoy 13% per annum finance charge on your existing balance with no upfront fee for 12 months (saving you from the potentially outrageous interest rate of up to 18%).\r\n###Fees and Charges\r\nA supplementary cardholder will only need to pay RM30 in annual fee for this card while a principal cardholder will need to pay an annual fee that is double of that amount at RM60. For the annual fee of the principal cardholder, it can be waived with a minimum of 12 transactions in a year. Prompt minimum repayments of the outstanding balance will allow the holder to enjoy the lowest tier finance charge at 13.5% per annum which otherwise can be as high as 17.5 per annum (if repayment record is bad). This card also has late payment penalty of RM5 or 1% of oustanding balance (whichever one is higher), up to a maximum of RM50.\r\n###Are You Eligible For The Bank Islam Classic Card-i?\r\nYou will need a minimum monthly income of RM2,000 and to be at least 21 years old to be able to get and enjoy the privileges that come with the Bank Islam Classic Card-i. For supplementary cardholder, the only requirement is to be least 18 years old.\r\n\r\nLooking for more options to choose from?
